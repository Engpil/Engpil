- 👋 Hi, I’m @Engpil
- 👀 I am interested in the cryptocurrency market and everything connected with it. 
- 🌱 I am now learning and generally improving in test nodes in order to become a validator of an operating node in a real network in the future.
- 💞️ I am looking for cooperation and generally like-minded people in this direction and in a number of other areas, for example, venture transactions.
- 📫 You can contact me on Twitter on Facebook Instagram, but best of all Telegram and I’ll leave my nickname below @Engpil
